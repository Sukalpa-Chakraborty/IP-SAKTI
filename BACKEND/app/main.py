"""
Main FastAPI application for IP-SAKTI Sahayak.

Keeps application wiring only: app creation, middleware, router registration and
health endpoints. Business logic lives in app/services and app/routers.

Schema management: Alembic owns the database schema (see alembic/versions).
There is deliberately no ``Base.metadata.create_all`` here - creating tables at
startup would bypass migrations and silently drift from the migrated schema.
