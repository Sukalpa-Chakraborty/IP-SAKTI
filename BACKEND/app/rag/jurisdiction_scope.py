"""
Jurisdiction scope for market-entry answers.

The selected target markets of the Product Passport version in the chat
control source retrieval, prompt context, answer structure and citations:

  * India         -> India sources
  * Germany       -> Germany + applicable European Union sources
  * United States -> United States sources (only when selected)

Rules enforced here (chatbot market-launch spec):

  * a source tagged to an unselected jurisdiction is dropped before the
    model ever sees it, and every filtering event is logged;
  * untagged chunks (private uploads, general material) stay citable as
    general background - never as a market-entry requirement;
  * when a selected market has no supporting source, the answer must say
    so with an explicit evidence-gap sentence instead of silently
    substituting another country's law;
  * U.S. regulatory references are stripped from produced answers unless
    the United States is a selected target market.

Nothing in this module invents sources, approvals or legal conclusions.
