"""
IP screening router (Phase 6).

Exposes the IP route map, patent screening and biodiversity / traditional-
knowledge screening:

  GET  /products/{product_id}/versions/{version_id}/ip-routes
  POST /products/{product_id}/versions/{version_id}/patents/search
  GET  /products/{product_id}/versions/{version_id}/patents
  POST /products/{product_id}/versions/{version_id}/patents/compare
  GET  /patents/{patent_id}
  POST /products/{product_id}/versions/{version_id}/biodiversity/screen
  POST /products/{product_id}/versions/{version_id}/traditional-knowledge/screen
  GET  /traditional-knowledge/sources

Every version-scoped route requires ownership of the enclosing product (ADMIN
bypasses), and all results are advisory and pinned to the version they reviewed.
