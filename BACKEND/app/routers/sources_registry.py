"""
Authoritative-sources registry router.

  GET /api/official-sources               filterable registry (auth)
  GET /api/official-sources/topics        distinct topics
  GET /api/official-sources/{source_id}   one entry (+ your permission state)

Why this prefix and not ``/api/sources``: ``app/routers/sources.py`` already
owns ``/api/sources``, ``/api/sources/search`` and ``/api/sources/{id}`` for
*corpus documents* (see tests/test_gap_endpoints.py). Registering a second
router at the same prefix would either shadow those routes or be shadowed by
``/api/sources/{source_id}`` (its ``str`` path param swallows every one-token
suffix such as ``/topics`` and returns 422). ``/api/official-sources`` is
collision-free in either registration order; the collision analysis is in
PRIVACY.md.

The response distinguishes FREE / FREE_REGISTRATION (direct access) from
PAID_SUBSCRIPTION / THIRD_PARTY_API / RESTRICTED_NOT_ACCESSED, which are
always returned with ``requires_permission: true`` and a ``restricted_note`` -
never as if they were directly accessible. Paid access is reached only
through POST /api/privacy/sources/consent + POST /api/privacy/sources/access.
