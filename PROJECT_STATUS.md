# IP-SAKTI Sahayak - Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2026-09-28

## Overall Status: ALL PHASES VERIFIED (0-13 complete)

**Latest verified (2026-09-28, session 5): Overall Product View - the Live
Demo section is replaced by a production data view backed by real stored
rows (spec items 16-19)**
- Reported: the "Live Demo" section showed synthetic demo data (risk gauges,
  fabricated patent nodes, hard-coded scores) instead of the selected
  Product Passport, and read like a prediction/approval tool.
- What was built: `GET /api/products/{id}/versions/{vid}/overview`
  (`app/services/overview_service.py` + `app/routers/overview.py`) returns the
  16-section stored-data contract with provenance on every value where
  practical, the deterministic overall-status precedence
  (COMPLETE_FOR_REVIEW / PARTIALLY_COMPLETE / INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION /
  ANALYSIS_NOT_RUN / ANALYSIS_OUTDATED / REVIEW_REQUIRED - never
  SAFE_TO_LAUNCH / APPROVED / LEGALLY_COMPLIANT / PATENT_SAFE / NO_RISK),
  the exact spec sentences, IP review that omits demo records
  (`records=[]` + `synthetic_records_omitted` + DEMO_CORPUS notice,
  SEARCH_UNAVAILABLE), and recommended actions derived only from actual gaps
  (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The chatbot receives the same object
  (`overview_context_for_chat`) so page and answer cannot diverge.
- Frontend: `/overview` and `/overview/:id/:versionId` (`App.jsx`
  `OverallProductView`) with version header + content hash (full hash on
  hover), 13 sections in spec order, per-section loading/empty/error/outdated
  states, key-derivation state so versions never mix, "Re-run analysis"
  wired to the real analyze endpoint; `/demo` redirects to `/overview`;
  `FormulationRiskDashboard.jsx` and `IPRiskMap.jsx` deleted; no "Live Demo"
  or "illustrative demo" text anywhere in `src`.
- Evidence: `tests/test_overview.py` (29) - full suite **386 passed**;
  new live `scripts/overview_live.py` **84/84 checks PASSED** (fresh
  AshwaBio-X passport -> screenings -> real comprehensive analysis -> claim
  edit forces ANALYSIS_OUTDATED; final output: ANALYSIS_OUTDATED/LOW
  confidence, claim USER_PROVIDED_ONLY / DO NOT PRESENT AS VERIFIED /
  REVIEW_REQUIRED, markets INDIA + GERMANY/EU, classification UNRESOLVED
  (source ANALYSIS_DERIVED), ip SEARCH_UNAVAILABLE with 4 synthetic omitted
  and 0 verified records, 4 analysis runs, 10 actions);
  `verify_frontend_flow.py` **139/139** against the restarted server;
  ESLint **12 = baseline**; `npx vite build` OK (462.58 kB).
- Environment note: the remote Supabase pooler was intermittently slow or
  dropping connections this session (fresh session setup measured at 9 s;
  two runs hit transport errors). Infra, not code - uvicorn restarted to
  clear the stale pool; the live script now reports transport errors as
  FAILs instead of crashing. Suggested follow-up: `pool_pre_ping=True`
  (not applied - stable module, out of scope).

**Previously verified (2026-09-27, session 4): Chatbot Product Passport access - the model now answers from the selected passport instead of denying access**
- Reported: with Context Options on AshwaBio-X V1 the chatbot said "I do not
  have the ability to access external product files or databases". Root
  causes: (1) the SYSTEM_PROMPT said "Answer ONLY using the provided context
  passages" while the passport arrived under a bare `=== PRODUCT CONTEXT ===`
  header with no usage instruction; (2) both generation paths aborted (and
  the selective path's Gate 1 abstained) before reading the model's answer
  whenever the corpus matched nothing, even with a passport selected.
- Fix: SYSTEM_PROMPT "WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO" inventory + new rule
  never to disclaim access to the product/files/database when PRODUCT
  CONTEXT is present; passport header "It IS available to you..." with
  attribution wording; passport-only questions reach the model in both paths;
  Gate 1 skips its abstain-out when `used_product_context` (provenance stays
  USER_PROVIDED, jurisdiction gate and banned-conclusion stripping intact).
  **Launch questions keep the deterministic evidence-gap path**
  (`launch_question` flag): spec TEST 4/5's `fake.calls == 0` guarantee is
  preserved - a passport can never prove launch readiness.
- Evidence: new `tests/test_chat_product_context.py` (12 tests); full suite
  **357 passed** (345 baseline + 12; 720s); live `passport_access_live.py`
  (real LLM, exact reported question + knowledge question against fresh
  AshwaBio-X V1) **8/8 checks PASS** - "Yes. I have access to the Product
  Passport version you provided ... AshwaBio-X, version 1", ingredients
  question returns the passport facts verbatim (Withania somnifera root,
  100 g, Uttarakhand), `insufficient_evidence=False`,
  `market_context=["India","Germany/EU"]`, zero 21 CFR leakage.

**Previously verified (2026-09-27, session 3): Chatbot jurisdiction scope - market-entry evidence, citations and UI**
- The chatbot now derives its jurisdiction scope from the selected Product
  Passport target markets: retrieval is filtered per market, the prompt carries
  the `MARKET CONTEXT` rules (per-market sections, no cross-country
  substitution, launch-readiness structure), produced answers are scrubbed of
  unselected U.S. references, and the response reports market context,
  jurisdiction filter, excluded jurisdictions, evidence status
  (SUFFICIENT/PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED/INSUFFICIENT + CANNOT_BE_DETERMINED),
  market-specific gap warnings, a "Why this answer?" payload and per-claim
  reviews (USER_PROVIDED_ONLY / NOT_FOUND / REVIEW_REQUIRED).
- Corpus metadata corrected on the live DB: 12 mislabelled documents (9 U.S.,
  1 China, 2 International) - U.S. 21 CFR CGMP can no longer pass as "India".
- Evidence: new `tests/test_chat_jurisdiction.py` (16 tests, spec TEST 1-10 +
  sanitizer/multi-part/sarvam parity) - full suite **345 passed** (329
  baseline + 16); ESLint **12 = baseline**; live `verify_frontend_flow.py`
  **139/139**; `spec18_live.py` (real LLM, exact launch question, fresh
  AshwaBio-X V1) **11/11 checks PASS** - answer opens "Launch readiness: Cannot
  be determined from the current information.", zero 21 CFR references, server
  log shows `Jurisdiction scope [India, Germany, European Union]: excluded 8
  candidate chunk(s) from China, United States`.

**Previously verified (2026-09-27, session 2): Product Passport analysis spec - the 12 reported bugs (BUG 1-12)**
- All twelve bugs root-caused (live-DB evidence) and fixed at the narrowest
  layer: claim provenance + run staleness (content_hash pinning), source
  location vs target markets, exact formulation shape with `"" -> null` and the
  "not yet provided" note, UNRESOLVED classification gate with the spec's five
  information requirements, five-field evidence-based IP routes, demo/verified
  corpus labelling everywhere, explicit source metadata (TKDL restricted label,
  human jurisdictions - no raw `IN`/`INT`, no "AVAILABLE IN"), analysis summary
  card, "Why this result?" explanations, change-impact areas/reassessment/missing
  info (exactly the seven spec areas for the acceptance scenario), the exact
  public-disclosure disclaimer (no deadlines), and report content built from the
  recorded claims/markets/formulation/provenance/corpus.
- Evidence: new `tests/test_acceptance_spec.py` (34 tests, acceptance steps
  1-14) - full suite **329 passed** (295 baseline + 34); ESLint **12 = baseline**;
  live `scripts/verify_frontend_flow.py` **139/139** after uvicorn restart;
  `spec17_live.py` (real LLM) **35/35**.

**Previously verified (2026-09-27): RAG selective/partial answering (master-prompt items 16-17)**
- Multi-part questions decompose and answer **per sub-part**; only unsupported
  sub-parts abstain (SUPPORTED / PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED / INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE
  per section, next_action on every abstention, no whole-question rejection).
- Evidence: `pytest tests/ -q` **286 passed**; exact spec-17 live scenario
  (real LLM) **16/16 checks passed** - overall PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED, 8
  validated citations with page numbers, 40% claim USER_PROVIDED /
  not-independently-verified / review_required, spec-vocabulary provenance,
  exact disclaimer, no banned conclusions.
- Semantic arm reactivated (`sentence-transformers` installed; live log shows
  `Retrieval arms: vector=20, keyword=20` + cross-encoder reranker +
  `embeddings=yes`); per-query diagnostics now reach the server log.

- **Status:** VERIFIED
- **Started:** 2026-09-23
- **Implemented / Verified:** 2026-09-23 00:10 IST
- **Evidence:**
  - 105/105 pytest tests pass (0 failures; 16 new Phase 5 tests)
  - `scripts/verify_phase5.py`: 37/37 checks pass against the real PostgreSQL database
  - `scripts/verify_migrations.py`: full downgrade/upgrade chain still verified transactionally at head `004`
  - Migration `004` applied: `CLAIM_ANALYSIS` added to the `analysistype` enum

#### Phase 5 Features Status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Claim-to-evidence analysis | VERIFIED | `POST .../versions/{id}/claims/analyze`; per-claim assessment with rationale, risk level and review status |
| Comprehensive product analysis | VERIFIED | `POST .../versions/{id}/analyze`; classification + claim review + market considerations + expert-review recommendations |
| Preliminary product classification | VERIFIED | Validated against the platform's own `ProductCategory` enum; always flagged `preliminary` |
| Structured AI output | VERIFIED | LLM JSON -> Pydantic validation -> citation validation -> safety clamp; malformed output is a controlled failure |
| AI provenance firewall | VERIFIED | AI output is stamped `AI_ANALYSIS` and can never suggest `supported` / `expert_verified` (clamped to `needs_evidence`) |
| EXPERT_VERIFIED protection | VERIFIED | Expert-verified claims are returned locked and are never assessed or altered by the AI |
| Citation validation | VERIFIED | Reuses the Phase 4 validator; chunk ids the AI was not given are dropped with a warning |
| Advisory-only analysis | VERIFIED | Running an analysis never mutates claims, evidence or ingredients (asserted in tests and live) |
| Analysis persistence | VERIFIED | One `analyses` row per run, pinned to the reviewed version with `content_hash` in the audit trail |
| Controlled AI failure | VERIFIED | An unavailable/erroneous model returns 503 and records a `FAILED` analysis row |
| Analysis retrieval | VERIFIED | `GET .../analyses` (+ `analysis_type` filter) and `GET .../analyses/{id}` |
| Analysis scoping | VERIFIED | Cross-user reads return 404; an analysis is not reachable through another version |
| Honest phase boundaries | VERIFIED | Later-phase stages are declared in `deferred_components` instead of appearing to work |
| Assistant source provenance | VERIFIED | Chat response reports `product_id`, `product_version_id` and `provenance` (PUBLIC_SOURCE / USER_PROVIDED) |
| Frontend integration | VERIFIED | Analysis section on the version page: run buttons, recorded-run picker, claim assessment cards (suggested status/risk/review/provenance badges), citations with quoted passages, classification, market considerations, missing information, deferred components, warnings; chat now renders source provenance |

**Not in this phase (deliberately deferred):** public-disclosure review (Phase 8).
The Phase 6 stages (`POST .../analyze` used to name them in `deferred_components`)
are now implemented and embedded in the comprehensive result.

### Phase 6: IP Route Map, Patent Screening, Biodiversity/ABS/TK Screening
- **Status:** VERIFIED
- **Started:** 2026-09-25
- **Implemented / Verified:** 2026-09-25 23:47 IST
- **Evidence:**
  - 130/130 pytest tests pass (0 failures; 25 new Phase 6 tests)
  - `scripts/verify_phase6.py`: 57/57 checks pass against the real PostgreSQL database
  - Migration `005` applied: `patent_records`, `patent_features` created (head is now `005`)
  - `scripts/verify_migrations.py` 5/5; `scripts/verify_frontend_flow.py` 90/90 live

#### Phase 6 Features Status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| IP route map | VERIFIED | `GET .../ip-routes`; nine routes (patent, trademark, copyright, design, GI, trade secret, plant variety, traditional knowledge, biodiversity/ABS), each deterministically derived with a careful label and the signals that triggered it |
| No AI-asserted applicability | VERIFIED | The route map is a rule engine over recorded data; a route is never presented as legally applicable |
| Patent screening (demo mode) | VERIFIED | `POST .../patents/search`; extracts technical features and screens against a frozen, labelled demonstration corpus |
| Patent feature comparison | VERIFIED | `POST .../patents/compare`; field-by-field matching / different / unknown verdicts with a similarity indicator and uncertainty note |
| Patent record retrieval | VERIFIED | `GET .../patents` and `GET /api/patents/{patent_id}`, both version- and owner-scoped |
| Demo data is never passed off as real | VERIFIED | `retrieval_mode=DEMO_CORPUS`, `search_is_live=false`, `is_demo=true`, `DEMO-...` ids, no real patent numbers, explicit demo-corpus note |
| No patentability conclusions | VERIFIED | Careful labels only (Potentially Relevant / Possible Technical Overlap / Further Review Recommended); never patentable, novel, valid or infringing |
| Biodiversity / ABS screening | VERIFIED | `POST .../biodiversity/screen`; status, considerations, missing information, review questions, sources |
| Traditional-knowledge screening | VERIFIED | `POST .../traditional-knowledge/screen`; public sources only |
| Restricted sources excluded | VERIFIED | `GET /api/traditional-knowledge/sources` distinguishes public / permitted / restricted; the TKDL is listed as restricted and is never accessed, searched or reproduced |
| Screening statuses | VERIFIED | Only the four allowed values: NO_IMMEDIATE_CONSIDERATION_IDENTIFIED, ADDITIONAL_INFORMATION_NEEDED, POTENTIALLY_RELEVANT, REVIEW_RECOMMENDED |
| Opt-in corpus sources | VERIFIED | `?include_sources=true` attaches only genuinely retrieved passages; a retrieval failure degrades with a warning rather than failing the screening |
| Version-pinned persistence | VERIFIED | Each screening is an `analyses` row pinned to the reviewed version; candidate records cascade with it |
| Advisory-only | VERIFIED | Screenings never mutate claims, evidence, ingredients or the formulation |
| Frontend integration | VERIFIED | "IP screening (Phase 6)" section on the version page: route map, patent screening with a feature table, re-run comparison, biodiversity/ABS and TK screens, TK source registry |

### Phase 7: Formulation Change Impact Simulator
- **Status:** VERIFIED
- **Started:** 2026-09-26
- **Implemented / Verified:** 2026-09-26 00:56 IST

### Phase 13: Integration Testing, Security Review, Documentation
- **Status:** VERIFIED (2026-09-26)
- **Evidence:**
  - Full pytest suite: 203/203 pass (incl. 5 auth tests fixed by the 401 correction)
  - `scripts/verify_demo_flow.py`: 26/26 live (full Ashwagandha acceptance flow)
  - `scripts/verify_frontend_flow.py`: 127/127 live
  - `scripts/verify_migrations.py`: 5/5 at head 009
  - Security pass: no hardcoded secrets, no raw SQL, upload validation, safe errors
  - README updated for phases 8-13; requirements + `.env.example` completed
  - Real bug fixed: keyword-only retrieval fallback when embeddings unavailable

## Current Blockers

None - all 13 phases implemented and verified.

### Phase 11: BHASHINI Integration
- **Status:** NOT_STARTED

### Phase 12: Frontend Integration
- **Status:** IN_PROGRESS (Phases 1-6 UI functional for testing)
- **Evidence:**
  - React + Vite frontend with Products/versions, version content, Knowledge Base, RAG Chatbot and Analysis
  - Production build passes with zero errors (`vite build`)
  - `scripts/verify_frontend_flow.py`: 108/108 checks against a live server, including the Phase 5 analyses endpoints, the Phase 6 IP/patent/biodiversity/TK endpoints and the Phase 7 change-impact endpoints the UI calls
  - Register/login/session-restore verified in a real browser against the live backend (2026-09-24): register 201, login 200, `/auth/me` 200, reload restores the session via the refresh cookie, and `/products` + `/knowledge` deep links render with authenticated API calls returning 200
  - Phase 6 UI verified in the browser (2026-09-25): the version page shows the "IP screening (Phase 6)" section; the IP route map, patent screening (4 records with a match/different/unknown feature table), biodiversity/ABS screen and TK screen all render with their disclaimers and the restricted-TKDL notice
  - Phase 7 UI verified in the browser (2026-09-26): the versions page runs a comparison and renders the ranked differences grouped by category, the expert-review reasons, the review questions and the not-compared list

### Phase 13: Integration Testing, Security Review
- **Status:** NOT_STARTED

## Current Blockers

None.

## Known Bugs

None open. The 2026-09-24 authentication-form bug (`res.json is not a function`,
422 on register/login, blank pages on deep links) is fixed, and the 2026-09-25
`Products` delete bug (an undeclared `setError` threw a `ReferenceError`) is fixed
too - see `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`.

## Known Issues / Technical Debt

1. **First AI analysis run downloads the embedding model.** Retrieval uses `BAAI/bge-m3` via `sentence-transformers`, which is not bundled. On a cold machine the first analysis (or RAG query) blocks on a multi-gigabyte HuggingFace download. Cache it during setup by running `scripts/ingest_corpus.py` or any RAG query once. Analysis resolves the LLM provider *before* retrieval, so a missing `GROQ_API_KEY` fails fast rather than after the download starts.
2. **`evidence.document_hash` stays null** - the column exists but is only meaningful once evidence files are uploaded (Phase 8).
3. **Analyses are not cached or deduplicated** - each `POST .../analyze` call performs a fresh (paid) model run. A content-hash-based cache would avoid re-running an unchanged version.
4. **Analysis results are stored in an `analyses` row that is never edited** - sound for auditability, but a superseded analysis is only distinguished by `created_at`.
5. **The frontend is a test UI, not a product UI** - one file, inline styles, no state library. It is deliberately minimal for manual testing through Phase 5.
6. **Legacy files at BACKEND root** - `main.py`, `models.py`, `auth/`, `databases/`, `hash/` are pre-Phase-1 dead code.
7. **Pydantic v2 deprecation warnings** - schemas still use class-based `Config`; migrate to `ConfigDict` when convenient.
8. **Restoring a session logs a 401 in the browser console** - on a first visit (no refresh cookie) `AuthProvider`'s `POST /api/auth/refresh` probe answers 401 by design. It is handled silently in the UI, but the browser's network log still shows it.
9. **The patent corpus is a demonstration corpus.** Phase 6 has no live patent source, so screening runs against `app/data/patent_demo_corpus.py` (`demo-patents-2026.09`). Every response says so. Replacing it with a real public-records source would flip `retrieval_mode` to `LIVE_SOURCE`; nothing else would change.
10. **Screening results are not cached** - each screening writes a new `analyses` row, as analyses do in Phase 5.
11. **`HF_TOKEN` must be declared in `Settings`.** Pydantic-settings forbids undeclared keys, so any new key added to `.env` must be added to `app/config.py` and `.env.example` or the app will not start.
12. **Change-impact classification comparison needs a recorded analysis.** The simulator compares the latest recorded preliminary classification of each version; when neither has one it reports classification as not comparable rather than guessing. A deterministic classification signal would remove that dependency.
13. **Public disclosure is not comparable yet** - the disclosures table does not exist until Phase 8, so change-impact runs list it in `not_compared`.
14. **Change-impact runs are not cached** - each run writes a new `change_impacts` row, like analyses and screenings.

history reloads show it, re-ingest the corpus (21 study files added on disk
2026-09-28, incl. the first Germany/EU source - DB still has none),
Bhashini key, user screenshots for visual verification of `/chat`. Handover:
`alembic upgrade head` (currently at `011`), `pytest tests/ -q` (345),
`verify_frontend_flow.py`, `verify_demo_flow.py`. Backend:
http://localhost:8000/api/docs.
