- [x] `register` sends `confirm_password` (the schema field name) and validates the 8-character minimum client-side
- [x] Human-readable FastAPI validation errors (field name + message) instead of `[object Object]`
- [x] Session restore via `POST /api/auth/refresh` (httpOnly cookie) instead of a credential-less login probe

- [x] `Button` forwards `type` so `type="button"` controls stop submitting their form
- [x] Verify in a real browser: register 201 -> login 200 -> `/auth/me` 200 -> reload keeps the session -> deep links work

- [x] `FormulationRiskDashboard` — live scoring + SVG gauges, cure-claim CRITICAL banner
- [x] `ProtectionTimeline` — before/after animated timelines with replay
- [x] `IPRiskMap` — D3 force graph (npm `d3`), draggable, tooltips, risk ring, legend
- [x] All three wired into `/demo` + nav; production build clean and verified in bundle
- [~] **Superseded 2026-09-28:** the Live Demo section is replaced by the
  Overall Product View (`/overview`); `FormulationRiskDashboard.jsx` and
  `IPRiskMap.jsx` deleted, `DemoShowcase` removed, `/demo` redirects;
  `d3` no longer imported by any component

### Verified auth endpoint reference (what the UI must send)
- `POST /api/auth/register` - JSON `{username, email, password, confirm_password}`; returns the user only, **no token**
- `POST /api/auth/login` - JSON `{email, password}`; returns `data.access_token` and sets the refresh cookie
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - no body; reads the refresh cookie, returns a new access token
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - no body; clears the refresh cookie

- [x] New `app/rag/jurisdiction_scope.py`: market -> allowed jurisdictions, scope filter with exclusion logging, `JurisdictionScopeTracker` (over-retrieve 18 / filter / trim 6, `retrieval.py` untouched), `MARKET CONTEXT` prompt block (rules 1-8, dynamic section names, ~10-part launch structure), launch-question detection, evidence status (SUFFICIENT / PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED / INSUFFICIENT + CANNOT_BE_DETERMINED + spec reason), exact rule-6 + launch-gap sentences, ordered 7-item missing-information list, claim standing, U.S.-reference sanitizer
- [x] Scope block threaded into both the single-shot (`generation.py`) and selective (`partial_answer.py`) prompts
- [x] `assistant.py`: scope from the selected version snapshot before filters; tracker wraps both retrieval paths; U.S.-reference stripping + per-section gap fallbacks + market gap warnings; 14 new `ChatResponse` fields; `filters_applied` market entries; `getattr(..., "rag_rerank_top_k", 6)` for partial settings stubs
- [x] `scripts/fix_corpus_jurisdictions.py` run on live DB: 12 docs corrected (9 United States, 1 China, 2 International); distribution India 96 / US 9 / untagged 7 / International 2 / China 1
- [x] Frontend: assistantMsg captures the new fields; `ChatMarketPanel` (MARKET CONTEXT / SOURCE SCOPE / EVIDENCE STATUS / JURISDICTION WARNING + gap warnings + collapsible "Why this answer?" with counts, exclusions, missing info, claim reviews) + CSS
- [x] Tests: `tests/test_chat_jurisdiction.py` (16) - full suite **345 passed**; ESLint **12 = baseline**; `verify_frontend_flow.py` **139/139**; `spec18_live.py` (real LLM, exact launch question) **11/11 checks PASS**
- [ ] Persist the panel metadata on `chat_messages` (migration) so old sessions show it after a history reload
- [ ] Ingest verified Germany/EU sources (first source file now on disk: `eu-germany-herbal-medicinal-product-market-access.md`, added 2026-09-28; still not ingested - gaps remain correct by design until then)
- [ ] Provide the Bhashini key (translation stays in honest fallback until then)

## Chatbot Product Passport access: no more "I cannot access your product" - VERIFIED 2026-09-27

- [x] Root-cause: SYSTEM_PROMPT said "Answer ONLY using the provided context passages" while the passport arrived under a bare `=== PRODUCT CONTEXT ===` header with no usage instruction; both generation paths aborted (and selective Gate 1 abstained) when the corpus matched nothing, even with a passport selected
- [x] `generation.py`: SYSTEM_PROMPT "WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO" inventory + rule 8 (never disclaim access to the product/files/database when PRODUCT CONTEXT is present); passport header "It IS available to you..." + attribution as "Product Passport (user-provided)"; `generate_rag_answer(launch_question=...)` - passport-only questions reach the model
- [x] `partial_answer.py`: same instructions in `PARTIAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT` rule 4 / `build_partial_prompt`; full-abstention and Gate 1 now honour `used_product_context` (provenance stays USER_PROVIDED; jurisdiction gate + banned-conclusion stripping intact)
- [x] `assistant.py`: threads `launch_question` into generation - **launch questions keep the deterministic evidence-gap path** (spec TEST 4/5 `fake.calls == 0`; a passport can never prove launch readiness)
- [x] Tests: `tests/test_chat_product_context.py` (12) - full suite **357 passed** (345 baseline + 12); live `passport_access_live.py` (real LLM, exact reported question + knowledge question, fresh AshwaBio-X V1) **8/8 checks PASS**
- [ ] Reword the single-path warning "produced from retrieved sources, but no verifiable citations were attached" when the ground is the passport, not retrieved sources

## Overall Product View: Live Demo replacement (spec items 16-19) - VERIFIED 2026-09-28

### Backend contract
- [x] `GET /api/products/{id}/versions/{vid}/overview` (`app/services/overview_service.py`, `app/routers/overview.py`, mounted in `main.py`)
- [x] 16-section stored-data JSON with provenance on every value where practical (product, overall_status, facts, formulation, ingredients, claims, evidence, target_markets, regulatory_classification, ip_review, biodiversity_abs_review, traditional_knowledge_review, disclosures, analysis_history, recommended_actions, missing_information, provenance, disclaimers)
- [x] Deterministic overall-status precedence + confidence (NOT_ASSESSED/LOW/LOW/MEDIUM/MEDIUM/HIGH); only the six allowed statuses - never SAFE_TO_LAUNCH / APPROVED / LEGALLY_COMPLIANT / PATENT_SAFE / NO_RISK
- [x] Exact spec sentences as constants (preliminary-decision-support notice, overdue-hash warning, no-market-evidence, no-patent-result, claim user-provided warning, no-evidence-documents, no-disclosure-event, TK restricted-sources, DEMO CORPUS label)
- [x] IP review omits demo records (`records=[]`, `synthetic_records_omitted`, `demo_notice`, SEARCH_UNAVAILABLE); no hard-coded risk values anywhere
- [x] Recommended actions derived only from actual gaps (run_analysis / rerun_analysis / add_*), priorities HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
- [x] Chatbot consumes the same object (`overview_context_for_chat` attached in `assistant.py`) - no second interpretation

### Frontend
- [x] `api.productOverview`; routes `/overview`, `/overview/:id/:versionId`; `/demo` -> `<Navigate to="/overview" replace />`
- [x] Sidebar link "Overall Product View"; home card + `Landing.jsx` links renamed (zero "Live Demo" / "illustrative demo" strings in `src`)
- [x] `OverallProductView` in `App.jsx`: version header (product, version, content hash w/ full hash on hover, created/updated, analysis status/run/timestamp) + "All versions" control; preliminary-decision-support notices; overall-status card with overdue alert + "Re-run analysis" (real `api.analyzeProduct`); 13 sections in spec order; Provenance footer; `OV_CSS`
- [x] Key-derivation state (no sync setState in effects) so switching versions reloads every section and never mixes versions; loading/empty/error/outdated/missing-info states per section
- [x] Deleted `FormulationRiskDashboard.jsx`, `IPRiskMap.jsx`; `DemoShowcase` removed
- [x] Editing stays on the passport pages - the overview never mutates a version

### Verification (2026-09-28)
- [x] `pytest tests/ -q` -> **386 passed** (357 baseline + 29 new `tests/test_overview.py`)
- [x] `scripts/verify_frontend_flow.py` -> **139/139** against restarted uvicorn
- [x] `scripts/overview_live.py` (new) -> **84/84 checks PASSED**, incl. outdated-analysis transition and version-scoped hash
- [x] `npm run lint` -> **12 = baseline**; `npx vite build` -> OK (462.58 kB)

### Follow-ups (not blocking)
- [ ] Visual browser check of `/overview` (no desktop browser connected this session - verified via lint, build and API contract only)
- [ ] `pool_pre_ping=True` on the SQLAlchemy engine - remote Supabase pooler dropped connections twice this session (stable module, out of scope)
- [ ] Version `updated_at` column is not stored - overview reports `updated_at: null` with an honest note
- [ ] Germany/EU corpus still empty **in the database** - a first source file exists on disk (2026-09-28) but is not ingested, so market sections still show the exact no-evidence sentence by design
- [ ] Replace the demonstration patent corpus with a real public-records source (existing Phase 6 follow-up)
- [ ] Bhashini key still not provided (translation stays in honest fallback)

## RAG corpus: 12 required statute/regulation study files - ADDED 2026-09-28

- [x] `drugs-and-magic-remedies-objectionable-advertisements-act-1954.md` (196)
- [x] `patent-amendment-rules-2024-india.md` (175)
- [x] `geographical-indications-act-1999-india.md` (206)
- [x] `trade-marks-act-1999-india.md` (215)
- [x] `designs-act-2000-india.md` (180) - typo fix applied in the same session
- [x] `copyright-act-1957-india.md` (199)
- [x] `plant-variety-farmers-rights-act-2001-india.md` (216)
- [x] `biological-diversity-rules-2024-india.md` (221)
- [x] `fssai-ayurveda-aahar-regulations-2022.md` (165)
- [x] `section-3j-3p-patenting-bar-tkdl-guidance.md` (217)
- [x] `first-schedule-authoritative-texts-ayurveda.md` (172)
- [x] `ayurvedic-pharmacopoeia-india-standards.md` (172)
- [ ] Re-ingest the corpus so the new files are embedded and chunked (run
  `scripts/ingest_corpus.py` against the live DB - not done in this session)
- [ ] After re-ingest, confirm the jurisdiction/metadata pass labels the new
  India files correctly (see the session-4 `fix_corpus_jurisdictions.py` run)

## RAG corpus: 9 international IP / regime / case-law study files - ADDED 2026-09-28

Closes the sources gap: international treaties/regimes (TRIPS, CBD, Nagoya,
PCT, Madrid, Hague, Budapest), Indian case law, and the first Germany/EU
market-access source. ADD only - no pre-existing corpus file was deleted,
renamed or modified.

| # | File | Lines |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `trips-agreement-1994-relevant-provisions.md` | 450 |
| 2 | `convention-biological-diversity-1992-cbd.md` | 307 |
| 3 | `nagoya-protocol-2010-access-benefit-sharing.md` | 369 |
| 4 | `patent-cooperation-treaty-pct.md` | 286 |
| 5 | `madrid-protocol-international-trademark-registration.md` | 249 |
| 6 | `hague-system-industrial-designs-registration.md` | 242 |
| 7 | `budapest-treaty-microorganism-deposit.md` | 250 |
| 8 | `indian-ip-case-law-compendium.md` | 370 |
| 9 | `eu-germany-herbal-medicinal-product-market-access.md` | 420 |

- [x] All 9 files: fixed frontmatter template, top-level official `source_url`,
  single-line `## Verification note`, `##`/`###` headings + tables for
  section-aware chunking (scripted check: PASS on all 9)
- [ ] Re-ingest the corpus so these 9 files are embedded and chunked too
  (`scripts/ingest_corpus.py` against the live DB - not done in this session)
- [ ] Confirm the jurisdiction/metadata pass labels these files as intended
  (India / International / Germany-EU)
- [ ] Germany/EU market evidence now has a source **on disk** but is still not
  ingested - market sections keep the honest no-evidence sentence until ingest
